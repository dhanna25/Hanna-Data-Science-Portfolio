This project is an interactive machine learning web app built using Streamlit that allows users to explore the fundamentals of supervised learning through logistic regression. The primary goal of the app is to create an educational and user-friendly environment where users can upload their own datasets or choose from a selection of preloaded ones, define a target variable, and instantly build, tune, and evaluate a logistic regression model. The app handles preprocessing automatically, including one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and label encoding, making it easy to work with both numeric and categorical data.

Users can interactively adjust the test-train split ratio and regularization strength (C) to observe how these hyperparameters affect model performance. Key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are clearly displayed, along with a detailed classification report. For binary classification problems, the app also generates a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculates the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. For multiclass problems, the app attempts to compute a multiclass AUC using one-vs-rest (OvR) methodology.

To run the app locally, users should first clone the repository and navigate to the project folder. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Once dependencies are installed, the app can be launched with streamlit run /Users/dinahanna/Documents/GitHub/Hanna-Data-Science-Portfolio/MLStreamlitApp/mlstreamlit.py, and will be accessible in the browser at localhost:8501. All necessary libraries include Streamlit, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib. A complete list with specific version numbers can be found in the requirements.txt file.

This project is inspired by practical tutorials on logistic regression and model evaluation using Scikit-learn, as well as interactive data exploration practices encouraged in the Streamlit documentation. The app references several built-in datasets such as Breast Cancer, Iris, Wine, and Digits to allow users to quickly experiment without needing to source their own data. Visual examples include metric dashboards, confusion matrices, and ROC curves, offering immediate feedback and intuitive understanding of model behavior.

By integrating educational datasets, automated preprocessing, model training, and performance visualization in a clean web interface, this project aims to support students, educators, and data science learners in building hands-on intuition for logistic regression. It also provides a simple, reproducible foundation for further machine learning projects or teaching demos.
