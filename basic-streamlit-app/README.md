# Basic Streamlit App

## Project Overview
This Streamlit app allows students to submit ratings of their study abroad experiences, visualizing the average ratings per city. It allows users to explore and submit ratings for their study abroad experiences. The app displays a table of students' ratings by city, along with a bar chart that shows the average rating for each city. Users can also submit their ratings, which are then added to the dataset, and the app will dynamically update the ratings by city.

## App Features
- **View Ratings**: See the ratings provided by students for different cities.
- **Submit Your Rating**: Add your rating for a specific city and share your study abroad experience.
- **Dynamic Data Update**: The app updates the ratings and visualizations after a new rating is submitted.
