# Hanna-Data-Science-Portfolio

## Hello! Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!
This is a repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic purposes. 

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally!
Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, VScode etc.

Streamlit Project: https://github.com/dhanna25/Hanna-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app
My streamlit app will serve to record and showcase students who have traveled abroad. The app will the ratings of their experience and present statistical data based on the ratings. This will be done with a chart that will demonstrate the mean score of ratings per city. The user will then be asked to select the city they traveled to and provide a rating for their experience. Once the user submits their response a new chart will appear which will include the users input in the means. This app is great for gathering feedback from students and visualizing study abroad experiences in real time!

Tidy Data project repository: https://github.com/dhanna25/Hanna-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project
This project demonstrates the ability to employ tidy data principles to disorganized data sets in order to make them more clear, comprehensible, and interpretable. To achieve this, the project requires reshaping, cleaning, and the inclusion of visualizations. This project compliments my overall coding portfolio due to the importance of tidy data. Tiny data is crucial in many scenarios and having the knowledge and ability to clean and organize real-world datasets is crucial in data analysis.
